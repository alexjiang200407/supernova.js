<h1 class="title">Adiabatic expansion</h1>
<p>N132D is currently undergoing the Adiabatic expansion phase when the photograph was created (Vogt and Dopita 2010 p. 1). During this phase, the ejecta slows down due to the forward shock sweeping up significant amount of material (Bamba and Williams 2022 p. 4). Deceleration often leads to a ‘reverse shockwave’ where the material decelerates towards the centre of the supernova remnant.</p>
