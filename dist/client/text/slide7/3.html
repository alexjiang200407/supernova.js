<p>The colours in the image are artificially assigned. The telescopes initially produce black-and-white images using exposure maps. For this composite:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blue represents data from Chandraâ€™s X-ray images, chosen because X-rays detect high-energy gas, and blue is commonly used to indicate high energy.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope images were colourized using filters that capture starlight in the blue, green, and red parts of the spectrum.</li>
