<p>To begin with, this image is a composite created using photographs from both the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory (Hubble 2005, sec. 1). It was released on October 4, 2005, under the identifier opo0530a. While the supernova itself occurred over 160,000 years ago, the light weâ€™re observing in this image is only about 3,000 years old, due to the finite speed of light.</p>
