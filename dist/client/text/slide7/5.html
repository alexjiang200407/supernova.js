    <li>The ‘pink’ colour in this image correlates with hydrogen whereas the streaks of dark ‘purple’ of the image represents Oxygen (NASA 2005d). </li>
    <li>Notice how the streaks of purple and pink are ‘ring shaped’ indicating that the gas has travelled many light-years away from their origin.</li>
    <li>The bright ‘spots’ on the image are stars. Even though these stars look like they are inside with the supernova remnant, they could be millions of light years away.</li>
