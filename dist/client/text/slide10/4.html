<p>Indeed, life on planet Earth would not be possible without the occurrence of at least one if not several, supernovae in our cosmic neighbourhood. Elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and others found in critical compounds such as water (H₂O), methane (CH₄), and ammonia (NH₃) originate from a supernova. Without this cosmic enrichment, the raw ingredients needed for complex chemistry, and ultimately biology would be absent from our solar system.</p>
