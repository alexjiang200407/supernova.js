<h1 id="stage-heading" class="title">What are supernovae?</h1>
<p>When a massive star—at least eight times the mass of the Sun—reaches the end of its life, it undergoes a spectacular explosion known as a supernova. Supernova.js will present a detailed timeline of the cosmic events before and after a supernova, highlighting its significance in shaping the universe.</p>
<p>We will begin by exploring the chemical processes that trigger a supernova. Next, we will analyze the explosion itself, identifying different types of supernovae and the energy they release. We will also examine cosmic enrichment and the formation of supernova remnants. Finally, we will discuss how a supernova leads to the transformation of a star into either a neutron star or a black hole.</p>
