<p>Some 170,000 light-years away, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, lies the supernova remnant <span class="has-text-weight-bold">N132D</span> (NASA 2005). Thousands of years ago, a massive star met a violent end in a cataclysmic explosion. Today, its remnants continue to glow brightly, spanning 80 light-years and containing material equivalent to 600 Suns (NASA 2005). But how did this remnant form? What forces shaped its intricate structure?</p>
