<h1 class="title">Dissipation</h1>
<p>When the gas has slowed down to around 200 km/s the gas begins to lose temperature exponentially (Bamba and Williams 2025 p. 6). This cooling does not occur uniformly, with the outer shell being much cooler than the inner shell. The inner shell propagates further expansion, enlarging the cooler outer shell, hence this phase being called the snowplough phase.</p>
