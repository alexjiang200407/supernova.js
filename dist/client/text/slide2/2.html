<p>During the main sequence phase, stars primarily fuse hydrogen into helium. Low-mass stars consume fuel more slowly and can sustain this process for trillions of years. However, all stars eventually exhaust their hydrogen supply. When this happens, low-mass stars expand into red giants, while high-mass stars grow into red supergiantsâ€”some of the largest stars in the universe, spanning thousands of times the width of our Sun.</p>
