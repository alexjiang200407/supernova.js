<p>As fusion continues, these massive stars produce heavier elements, converting hydrogen into carbon, then carbon into oxygen, magnesium, and neon, until finally reaching iron. However, fusing iron requires more energy than it releases, causing the nuclear reactions that once stabilized the star to cease. Without the outward pressure from fusion, gravity causes the core to collapse, triggering a supernova.</p>
