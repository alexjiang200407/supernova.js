<p>N132D is a core-collapse supernova (Blair et. al 2000 p. 687) of Type Ib or Type 2. This conclusion was reached through the abundance of oxygen within their mantles that suggest one of two theories with the second being more widely accepted:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Star were low-mass and was unable to finish oxygen burning before the supernova</li>
    <li>The Star was very high mass; however, the supernova did not penetrate deep into the star to reveal the heavier elements. We will assume this is the correct route moving forward.</li>
</ol>
