<p>Firstly, let us define a supernova. A supernova is the explosion of a star. There are two ways a supernova can occur, from core collapse or from the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (Swinburne University 2007). Among core collapse supernova, there are three subclassifications based on the spectral analysis:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Type 1b: Explosion possesses helium but no silicon or hydrogen</li>
    <li>Type 1c: Explosion has no silicon, helium or hydrogen</li>
    <li>Type 2: Explosion possesses hydrogen</li>
</ul>
