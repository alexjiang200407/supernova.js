<h1 id="stage-heading" class="title">Why do supernovae occur?</h1>
<p>To understand why a supernova occurs, we must first examine the life cycle of a star. Once a star forms, it undergoes nuclear fusion, a process in which its core fuses atomic nuclei to create heavier elements. Nuclear fusion releases energy, which counteracts the force of gravity and prevents the star from collapsing.</p>
